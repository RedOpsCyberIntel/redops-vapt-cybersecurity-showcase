# RedOps LLM Threat Intelligence Framework

This framework maps LLM-related cyber threats across the MITRE ATT&CK lifecycle.

## 🎯 Goal

Support red team engagements involving:
- AI-powered phishing
- Prompt injection
- Data leakage via LLM use

---

| Tactic | LLM Risk |
|--------|----------|
| Recon  | NLP scraping of PDFs, job posts |
| Initial Access | Spear phishing via GPT-generated content |
| Execution | Prompt-based system command injection |
| Persistence | LLM memory abuse / hidden prompt storage |
| Exfiltration | Chatbot response leakage or C2 embedding |

## 🧠 RedOps Use Cases

- Audit AI usage in enterprise security stack
- Pen test LLM-based features (e.g., AI chatbots)
- Conduct Red Team exercises simulating AI threats
